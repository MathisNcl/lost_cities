# Lost Cities

Welcome to my personal implementation of the Lost Cities card game structure. This is a very entertaining card game created by Reiner Knizia. In this game, you play one-on-one to score as many points as possible. You can play it in 5 or 10 rounds, adding up your scores for each round.

In my implementation, it's possible to play against a computer that follows personal rules.

For the moment, there is no GUI (incoming). I am looking to set up an online interface to play with a friend or against a computer.
